###Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Entity Framework with PostgreSQL through a Pokémon filtering application. The project consists of two components:
1. A data processing script that retrieves and converts data from PokéAPI into PostgreSQL tables.
2. A filtering app that allows users to search and filter Pokémon by various attributes.

The repository contains three versions of the app:
The fully completed app
The try-it-yourself version, including only the filtering part of the app and UI
A bare-minimum version, containing only the UI and methods associated with it
